# Crystal Collector Game

This is a simple math game written in JavaScript and jQuery. The game consists of four crystal buttons that each add a specific amount of points to the player's total score when clicked. The player wins if their total score matches a random number generated at the start of the game. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on a crystal to reveal its point value.
3. Each time you click on a crystal, its point value will be added to your score.
4. Try to get your score to match the random number displayed at the start of the game.
5. If your score goes above the random number, you lose the game.
6. If your score matches the random number, you win the game.
7. The game will automatically restart and generate a new random number and crystal values.
